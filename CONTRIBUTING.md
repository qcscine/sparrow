Contribution Process

The development for this code is done in a private repository maintained by the 
Reiher Research Group. GitHub is only used for the official releases.

If you would like to contribute a larger change, please write to <scine@phys.chem.ethz.ch>.
For smaller changes, you can create a pull request on GitHub. If we agree with
the changes, a member of the Reiher Research Group will include them in our
development code. Of course, we will give proper acknowledgment for any external
contribution (see below for a list of all contributors). As soon as these changes 
are available in an official release, we will close the corresponding pull requests 
and/or issues on GitHub.

Please note that contributing a small change does in no way mean that you will
be added to the author list of a future paper and/or Zenodo entry!
